Description: In recent years a wealth of biological data has become available
        in public data repositories. Easy access to these valuable data 
        resources and firm integration with data analysis is needed for
        comprehensive bioinformatics data analysis.  biomaRt provides an
        interface to a growing collection of databases implementing the
        BioMart software suite (<http://www.biomart.org>). The package enables
        retrieval of large amounts of data in a uniform way without the need to
        know the underlying database schemas or write complex SQL queries. 
        The most prominent examples of BioMart databases are maintain by Ensembl, which
        provides biomaRt users direct access to a diverse set of data and enables
        a wide range of powerful online queries from gene annotation to 
        database mining.
