CHANGES IN VERSION 2.42.0
-------------------------

NEW FEATURES

    o The results of queries will now be cached, and if repeated queries
    are detected the results are loaded from disk.  
    
MINOR CHANGES

    o Ensembl users will be redirected to their closest mirror unless the 
    host argument is explicitly provided.  In this case the defined value
    will be enforced.
    o Unused argument 'ssl.verifypeer' removed from listMarts() and useMarts().
    o RCurl removed from package dependecies.
    
BUG FIXES

    o Improvements made to selecting the correct port when using http
    vs https
    o Results that contain unescaped new line characters are now returned
    successfully.

CHANGES IN VERSION 2.36.0
-------------------------

BUG FIXES

    o Patched problem returning the list of available datasets, if the 
    description of one or more datasets included an apostrophe (introduced
    with new primate species in Ensembl).
    o Caught scenario where ensemblRedirect=FALSE was still being ignored.
    o Changed query submission when redirection is detected to cope with 
    apparently new behaviour of the Ensembl mirrors.
    
MINOR CHANGES

    o Increase query timeout limit to 5 minutes.
    
    
CHANGES IN VERSION 2.34.0
-------------------------

NEW FEATURES

    o Added the listEnsemblArchives() function.  This returns a table of the
    available Ensembl archives, and replaces the archive = TRUE argument to
    several functions, which was no longer working.

BUG FIXES

    o The Ensembl BioMart server doesn't always respond well if queries with
    more than 500 filter values are submitted.  If a query that exceed this is
    detect biomaRt will now submit the query in batches and concatonate the 
    result when completed.
    
MINOR CHANGES

    o You can now provide a host with 'http://' at the start, or a trailing
    '/' (typically copy/pasted from a browser) and useMarts() etc will cope.

CHANGES IN VERSION 2.32.0
-------------------------

BUG FIXES

    o Fixed bug when columns were not returned in the order requested,
    which resulted in the wrong column names being added to the result.

CHANGES IN VERSION 2.30.0
-------------------------

SIGNIFICANT USER-LEVEL CHANGES

    o Updated vignette to use BiocStyle and execute most code chunks.
